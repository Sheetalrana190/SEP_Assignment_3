## Given Scenario
We are working with an AI developer who uses web scraping to generate training data. The client has specific needs and challenges regarding categorizing training questions and ensuring balanced data. 
After few meetings with the client we have able narrowed down to following needs and challenges.
## Problem 1 : 
### Training Questions
Developers want to have categorized training questions that are separate from the answers because developers care about self-affirmation.
## Problem 2 :
### Balanced Training Data
Developers want to know that the training data they are using is "balanced" (does not contain biases) because this will give them better AI models.
